        <p>Sponsored by the Democracy Fund, The GovLab’s CrowdLaw for Congress (congress.crowd.law) project explores how lawmaking bodies around the world are turning to CrowdLaw, or the use of new technology to foster an efficient two-way conversation with the public to improve the quality and legitimacy of lawmaking.</p>

        <p>Drawing from research on over a hundred CrowdLaw cases and myriad interviews with leading practitioners, these 20 practical recommendations explain how to introduce 21st century lawmaking techniques that engage the public at each stage of the lawmaking process.

                      In Brazil, Mudamos is a tool and process designed specifically for the public to draft their own bills and get others to sign onto them. TransGov in Ghana, by contrast, is used to evaluate the implementation of legislation after-the-fact. </p>

                    In Connecticut, the CityScan project succeeded because local governments committed to fix the issues citizens pointed out in this social auditing process.
