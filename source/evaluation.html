{% contentfor summary %}
<p class="text">
    Evaluation and oversight examines how a law is working, for whom, and at what cost. Although Congress has extensive oversight responsibilities, public participation in this stage of the legislative process is limited. With new technology, however, a watchful community can improve the outcomes of lawmaking by collectively monitoring the outcomes and impact of legislation. This participatory evaluation approach is also referred to as “social auditing” or “civic auditing”. Resident engagement in this stage is used to monitor the outcomes and evaluate the impact of laws on the overall well-being of the community. For example, the Promise Tracker campaign to monitor school lunch quality in Brazil has achieved success by inviting residents to use mobile phones to verify if lunches met program standards. At this stage, online participation gives lawmakers the potential to enhance accountability.

    <li><b>Method definition:</b> Online social auditing is the use of technology to engage the public in collectively monitoring and evaluating the effects of policies and laws. The use of technology has two key benefits. First, it can scale participation in periodic evaluations by drawing on a wider range of expert analysis and the collective experience of those affected by a policy or law to inform future policy formulation. Second, it can enable effects to be monitored in real time to improve existing service delivery.

    <dt><b>Description:</b></dt>
    <dd>The Science and Technology Committee of the United Kingdom’s Parliament launched the Evidence Check programme in 2016 to ascertain “what evidence underpins which policy in specific areas, how robust that evidence is, what the gaps are, and to determine how closely based on the evidence policies are.” An evidence check can be called for on a particular topic. For instance, the program has invited individuals and organizations to provide evidence underlying proposed policies on topics ranging from gender wage gaps to healthcare technology. The program uses a basic web forum to collect submissions and evidence from contributors, once the forum is closed to submissions the committee publishes next steps on the issue. </dd>
