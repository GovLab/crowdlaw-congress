{% contentfor summary %}
<p class="text">
  Once lawmakers have developed a shared and actionable definition of a problem, they face the challenge of devising effective and workable solutions. New technology presents a chance to obtain innovative, creative and diverse expertise from around the country and around the world. Through online tools, people can suggest, deliberate upon, and critique proposed approaches to solving a problem, broadening public input beyond that available to legislators and their staffs through occasional hearings. In particular, online engagement creates the opportunity to get good ideas from diverse sources. For example, Parlement & Citoyens in France enables citizens to submit proposals on the causes and solutions to a problem posed by a representative. Citizens’ proposals are then synthesized, debated, and incorporated into the resulting draft legislation. At this stage, online participation in developing solutions gives lawmakers the potential to enhance innovation.

<ul>
  <li>Online brainstorming</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Method definition:</b> Also known as open innovation, this is a style of collaboration that uses online tools to bring together the collective knowledge and expertise of widely dispersed individuals with good ideas about how to solve a problem. The best examples of online brainstorming provide the opportunity for participants to rate each others’ ideas and collaborate on improving them.

  <li>Prize-backed challenges</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Method definition:</b> A prize-backed challenge is a specific form of crowdsourcing ideas that seeks to accelerate and create incentives for idea generation by offering a prize. Prizes can include cash or gifts like an iPad, technical support and coaching, or simply publicity and recognition for participants.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Smarter Crowdsourcing</li>
  <ul><li>
    <b>Method:</b> Smarter Crowdsourcing is the application of data-rich tools to help match the supply of citizen expertise to the demand for it in government. Rather than rely on a wide call for ideas and expertise that can elicit an unmanageable number of low value contributions, these tools enable you to engage with those with the most relevant skills, experiences, and ground-level street smarts for the problem you are addressing.
