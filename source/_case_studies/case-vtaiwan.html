   <p class="e-h2"> How Does It Work?</p>
   <p>vTaiwan is a four-stage online and offline process for moving from issue to legislative enactment while building consensus among diverse stakeholders. It has been used to craft 26 pieces of legislation relating to the digital economy collaboratively between the government and the public. vTaiwan relies on a series of existing open source tools (meaning they can be freely modified and customized, as needed). The process begins with a member of the public proposing an issue and a relevant government agency agreeing to steward and participate in the process. Since 2017, each Ministry is obliged to appoint a Participation Officer responsible for engaging in the process.
   </p>
</div>
<ol start="1">
   <li> Proposal Stage - Offline and online discussion of which problems to address using <a
         href="https://www.discourse.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295446000">Discourse</a> &nbsp; for discussion, <a
         href="https://www.sli.do/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295446000">sli.do</a> &nbsp;for document sharing and <a
         href="https://www.typeform.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295447000">Typeform</a> &nbsp;for frequent
      questionnaires. </li>
   <li> Opinion Stage- Discussion then moves to an online process of getting input, taking advantage of an artificial
      intelligence (AI) tool known as <a href="https://pol.is/home&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295447000">Pol.is</a>
      &nbsp;to collect and visualize participants&rsquo; views, which becomes the basis for determining the extent of
      consensus about the nature of a problem. During this stage participants post their statements about the problem
      and can vote to Agree, Disagree or Pass on statements written by others or indicate if the statement is important
      to them. &nbsp;As voting progresses an algorithm is used to sort participants into opinion groups, capturing what
      each group feels most strongly about, how a group perceives what the problems are and areas where people are
      divided and where there is consensus. Presented as a visualization, this &ldquo;opinion landscape&rdquo; is made
      available to the public and the relevant government agencies. This so-called &ldquo;crowdsourced
      consensus-mining&rdquo; makes the process of obtaining information about the &ldquo;dynamics of the issue, the
      facts of the matter, what is at stake, and who is involved&rdquo; efficient and scalable. &nbsp; </li>
   <li> Reflection Stage - Following the opinion stage &nbsp;are two in-person stakeholder meetings where notes are
      taken online using <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/hackpad&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295448000">HackPa</a> <a
         href="https://github.com/dropbox/hackpad&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295448000">d</a> &nbsp; and, to extend
      participation and maximize transparency, &nbsp; <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DStUIhvbfA9Q&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552459295449000">livestreamed online</a>
      &nbsp;with a chatroom where anyone can comment. &nbsp;The goal is determine if the issue is ripe for advancement.
   </li>
   <li> Ratification Stage - In some cases, the issue is resolved with a guideline, policy, or statement from the
      competent government agency. This often includes a point-by-point explanation of why legislation is not being
      enacted. In others, it is formulated into a draft bill to be sent to the Yuan (Taiwanese Legislature). </li>
</ol>
<p> All the steps are combined onto a single set of webpages on the vTaiwan website so that the public and public
   servants alike can easily track the progress of an issue. Taiwan&rsquo;s Digital Minister stresses that the process
   is flexible and the path often deviates from this roadmap. Some issues have taken as few as three months to settle
   while others have taken over a year. </p>
<p class="e-h2"> What are the outcomes? </p>
<p>In Taiwan, 200,000 people have participated in this open policymaking process to define the problem around such
   complex issues as Uber, telemedicine, online alcohol sales and other hard topics. More than &nbsp;80% of processes
   once initiated lead to &ldquo;decisive government action.&rdquo; The Taiwanese have used the process to formulate 26
   pieces of national legislation over the last five years.</p>
<p class="e-h2"> What does it cost? </p>
<p>The vTaiwan process uses a number of different tools, most of which are free. The standard price for using Pol.is is
   $5,000 per month and $48,000 per year for unrestricted use and unrestricted support from the team. The cost and
   service-level are negotiable. The entire process is run and maintained by volunteers with support from the
   government&rsquo;s Digital Ministry, which spends about $100,000 on the project. </p>
<p class="e-h2"> What are the benefits? </p>
<ul>
   <li> Joint ownership between government and civil society builds trust &nbsp;and reduces the risk of failure while
      sharing workload. </li>
   <li> Flexible and transparent process enhances legitimacy. </li>
   <li> Combination of online and offline fosters participation by diverse audiences, </li>
</ul>
<p class="e-h2"> What are the risks? </p>
<ul>
   <li> Focus on generating consensus may conflict with the need for urgent response. </li>
   <li> Not all Ministries or public officials are convinced of the efficacy of the process. </li>
   <li> Online process tends to favor discussion of technology-related topics. </li>
</ul>
<p> vTaiwan has facilitated productive discourse among thousands of people at a time on a range of key issues. The
   process has helped resolve disputes between groups, ease concerns among citizens, and ultimately shape more effective
   and representative policies. </p>

{% contentfor introduction %}
<p>For three weeks in April 2014, students, academics, and everyday citizens piled into the Taiwanese Parliament in
   Taipei to protest the passage of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement aimed at liberalizing trade with China. The
   government negotiated the Agreement behind closed doors giving rise to protests now known as the <a
      href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/03/31/2003586930&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400342000">Sunflower
      Movement</a>. &nbsp;<a href="https://g0v.tw/en-US/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400343000">g0v.tw,</a>&nbsp;the largest
   civic tech community in Taiwan--which was founded to promote government transparency and the use of tools to enable
   citizen participation-- led the protests.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese government responded to the demonstration by acknowledging the public&rsquo;s peaceful demands. In
   turn, former Taiwanese Minister without Portfolio Jaclyn Tsai attended a g0v.tw hackathon in December 2014 and asked the volunteers if they
   could &ldquo;create a platform for rational discussion and deliberation of policy issues that the entire nation could
   participate in.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp; If they were up to the challenge, Tsai
   committed that the government would participate and respond.Shortly after, the g0v.tw volunteers built <a
      href="https://vtaiwan.tw/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400344000">vTaiwan</a>:&nbsp;an open consultation process to
   bring together experts, government officials, and relevant citizens on a national scale to deliberate, reach
   consensus, and craft legislation.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="e-quote">
   <p class="">Shortly thereafter, the g0v.tw volunteers built <a
         href="https://vtaiwan.tw/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400344000">vTaiwan</a>:&nbsp;the open consultation process to
      bring together experts, government officials, and relevant citizens on a national scale to deliberate, reach
      consensus, and craft legislation.</b><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>vTaiwan has since transformed into a systematic online and offline process to reach consensus on large-scale issues and craft national legislation, helping
   lawmakers implement decisions with a greater degree of legitimacy. While this case focuses on
   vTaiwan&rsquo;s influence on the problem identification stage, it is important to note that vTaiwan enables public participation in each step of the lawmaking process.</p>
{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor mechanics %}
<p>At the time of vTaiwan’s inception, instead of g0v.tw ceding control of the program to the government, its inventors
   and stakeholders decided that vTaiwan should exist as a platform independent of government, run collaboratively
   between civil society and the public sector. vTaiwan was founded with the agreement that the government will use the
   opinions gathered throughout the process to shape legislation on any given issue related to the digital economy. Now,
   three parties are in charge of its operations:<sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<ol start="1">
   <li>Issue sponsors: the government agencies which submit drafts of laws and regulations that they are proposing.</li>
   <li>Editors: individuals affiliated with the Science & Technology Law Institute, a government-sponsored NGO, who
      collect and organize the drafts into a format more conducive to discussion.</li>
   <li>Administrators: g0v's vTaiwan task force, which works together to maintain the online system and update the
      content.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although vTaiwan is government-funded, because volunteers run the process, it enjoys a relatively high degree of
   legitimacy.</p>
<div class="e-quote">
   <p class="">The process comprises four distinct phases: proposal, opinion, reflection and
      legislation.</p>
</div>
<p>The platform’s administrators, however, stress that the system is flexible and the path of an idea often deviates
   from the ideal type depicted in this roadmap.<sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; Some issues
   have taken as few as three months to settle while others have taken more than a year.</p>

<ol type="I">
   <li>Proposal Stage</li>
   <ol type="A">
      <li>Diverse people including programmers, developers, public servants, journalists, scholars, legal specialists,
         and students convene both online or offline for a weekly mini-hackathon hosted by vTaiwan every
         Wednesday.<sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></li>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>At these mini hackathons, contributors propose an issue of their choosing to a “competent government
            authority”<sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;who may choose to either accept (thereby
            becoming accountable for the issue) or refuse to take on the topic of the proposal. Notably, a proposed
            issue will not initiate the vTaiwan process without a government authority agreeing to become accountable
            for it, and a facilitator taking charge of the issue.</li>
         <li>The facilitator must be present to guide the issue through each stage of the process. He/she uses a
            “Focused Conversation Method” to lead discussion throughout each stage. This method is summarized as
            follows:</li>
         <ol type="a">
            <li>Objective - participants share facts and data (e.g., vTaiwan is a project)</li>
            <li>Reflective - participants express their emotions and feelings about the objective facts (e.g., I think
               vTaiwan is a great project and here’s why)</li>
            <li>Interpretive - participants exchange opinions and values (e.g., vTaiwan is a project that should expand)
            </li>
            <li>Decisional - participants make decisions and reach consensus (e.g., we concluded that vTaiwan expands
               within a month)</li>
         </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Tools - during the proposal stage, notes taken during mini hackathons are shared using a collaborative
         notetaking tool (<a href="https://hackpad.tw/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400347000">Hackpad</a>), while documents
         and presentations are shared using <a
            href="https://www.slideshare.net/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400348000">SlideShare</a>.</li>
      <li>Stakeholder Identification - The community<sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;researches
         and identifies relevant stakeholders. In this case study, stakeholders are defined as any person or group
         affected by and/or has knowledge about the given issue.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <li>Opinion Stage - Public opinion regarding the issue is gathered through several methods as the issue gets further
      refined.</li>
   <ol type="A">
      <li>The vTaiwan community launches the opinion collection process and produces a description of the case in a form
         digestible by stakeholders and the general public. This includes publishing any documents, research and/or
         presentations relevant to the proposal. If there is terminology that is difficult to understand, it is compiled
         into an open dictionary, where everyone can contribute to make things clearer.</li>
      <li>“Rolling Questionnaires” - first, in an effort to keep the ball rolling and collect as many valuable opinions
         as possible, stakeholders within the community’s network are sent questionnaires which ask what they know about
         the issue and their experiences with it. Notably, stakeholders are also asked if they can recommend others with
         knowledge and/or experience relevant to the issue. Subsequently, other individuals are sent the same survey,
         often via online advertisements and Facebook. Several actions are taken to maintain privacy but also to enhance
         the opinion collection process and augment the crowd that is surveyed.
      </li>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>The respondent has the option to either keep their responses confidential within the vTaiwan community or
            publish his/her opinions publicly.</li>
         <li>Either way, the respondent has the option to remain anonymous.</li>
         <li>The respondent is also asked whether they would like to undergo a more in-depth interview.</li>
         <li>The respondent is given the option to subscribe to email updates regarding the issue.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The vTaiwan community creates an online forum on which anyone, not restricted to Taiwan residents, can ask
         questions, comment on ideas or choose to “agree,” “disagree” or “pass” on others’ ideas, and that forum is open
         for a designated period of time. Each round of opinion collection lasts for at least one month, but there is no
         limit to the number of rounds.</li>
      <li>In order to foster consensus building, however, the process then calls for using <a
            href="https://www.discourse.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400349000">Discourse</a>&nbsp;(discussion tool) and
         Pol.is (opinion mapping).</li>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>Discourse is a discussion platform which allows users to tag competent authorities, who, in turn, are
            obliged to respond to comments within seven days.</li>
         <li>Pol.is is an opinion mapping tool to help a large group build consensus by helping the group to visualize
            its own opinions.</li>
         <ol type="a">
            <li>The Pol.problem definition process with the public unfolds in multiple phases. In the first round,
               organizers, followed by participants, write statements about the problem. In other words, the organizers
               create sample problem statements to prompt discussion.</li>
            <li>In the second round, participants are asked to ‘Agree,’ ‘Disagree’ or ‘Pass’ on those statements or
               answer “Is This Statement Important to You.”
            </li>
            <li>Statements are shown to all participants based on a comment routing system that gives each statement a
               priority score based on the responses it has received so far. Every person who enters the conversation
               sees a different ordering of the statements to avoid bias. As voting progresses, the algorithm then finds
               the underlying structure of the conversation using unsupervised machine learning. The software analyzes
               the votes and visualizes them in a <a
                  href="https://pol.is/report/r32beaksmhwesyum6kaur&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400350000">real-time
                  report</a>&nbsp;known as an opinion landscape.</li>
            <li>Through multiple rounds of the process, it becomes easier to see where there is consensus or
               disagreement and by whom.</li>
            <li>Once the opinion process is closed, all interactions are reviewed, analyzed, and curated by the vTaiwan
               community. They are used to publish two reports (“raw and second-hand”)<sup><a href="#ftnt8"
                     id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;on the results of the opinion collection stage that are viewable
               by the public and also submitted to the relevant government authority. The reports are used as materials
               to set the agenda and as a topic of discussion for the upcoming mini-hackathon and consultation meeting.
            </li>
         </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Reflection - a shorter stage comprised of two face-to-face events to reflect on findings thus far and
         determine if it is time to proceed or undergo another round of opinion collection.</li>
      <li>If the competent authority and the g0v.tw participants conclude that it is time to proceed, then they design
         an in-person consultation and:</li>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>Identify the proper facilitator for the meeting.</li>
         <li>Define the size and scope of the issue with the competent government agency.</li>
         <li>Host a pre-meeting with the facilitator and competent authority at least one week prior to the consultation
            meeting.</li>
         <li>Create a plan for the meeting, which includes a rundown, an agenda, a list of invited guests and
            participants, and other logistical details.</li>
      </ol>
   </ol>
</ol>

<p class="e-caption">Figure 2: Example of Pol.is opinion groups being formed<sup><a href="#ftnt9"
         id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Then, the in-person consultation meeting is held, which invites key stakeholders, including scholars, public
   servants, private sector representatives and participants who were deemed highly active during the earlier stages, are invited.
   Although an invitation is required to participate in-person,the consultation meeting is<a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DStUIhvbfA9Q&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400351000">livestreamed
      online</a>&nbsp;via YouTube with a chatroom where anyone can contribute ideas, so that everyone can be
   involved even if they cannot physically attend. The facilitator decides which contributions from the chat to
   incorporate into the meeting, choosing “insightful and valuable opinions” to include. The meeting is also recorded
   and transcribed to be used as materials for the next action. The meeting begins with the facilitator describing a
   summary of the issue’s process thus far. Then, stakeholder groups are allowed to give presentations. During this
   process, the facilitator takes notes digitally to document a summary in real-time, which is all displayed on the
   projector. Following the meeting, the videos are released on the vTaiwan Facebook page so that citizens can continue
   to share ideas in the following weeks.

</ol>
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor beta %}
<p>Minister Audrey Tang emphasizes the importance of seeing the process as an experiment that can and will always be
   improved upon and modified . She explained that:

   “vTaiwan’s scope is not limited to Taiwan or any particular government; it’s an experiment to prototype a model for
   consensus generation among large groups in general.”
</p>
<div class="e-quote">
   <p class="">&ldquo;vTaiwan’s scope is not limited to Taiwan or any particular government; it’s an experiment to
      prototype a model for consensus generation among large groups in general.&rdquo;</p>
   <p class="e-quote-author"><span class="e-bold-italic">Audrey Tang, Digital Minister, Taiwan</span></p>
</div>
<p>Moreover, she described it as, “an experiment for a new way of working together, to unconditionally trust when
   collaborating, to be more open and transparent, and to gain the potential to be trusted.”
</p>

<p>The process is inherently adaptive, meaning each issue discussed through vTaiwan may follow a different path. No two
   issues are assumed to be identical in nature and there is scope for each issue to be subject to a unique process,
   with progress determined by the community involved. In some cases, all four stages are not required. For example, in
   the case of developing a <a href="https://vtaiwan.tw/topic/sandbox&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400354000">Fintech
      Sandbox</a>, an effort to liberalize regulation and allow innovative financial technology companies to thrive, the
   reflection stage was skipped because there was pressure for immediate legislation. Similar regulatory sandboxes for electric scooter usage, autonomous vehicles, and the 5G spectrum network are currently in development on vTaiwan.

</p>

<p>There is no set policy in place to decide when an issue advances from one stage to the next. Rather, the vTaiwan
   community decides this when they reach a “rough consensus” at any given point in the process, based on the situation
   at the time. According to PDIS Co-founder Shu-Yang Lin, “every case is different, and should be treated
   differently.”&rdquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than aspiring to become a “best practice” for citizen engagement, vTaiwan’s stated goal is to advance
   knowledge and research in the field of digital and participatory democracy, so that other governments and
   institutions--including its own--may learn from it. </p>

{% contentfor participation %}
<p>Since the platform’s launch in 2015, over 80 percent of vTaiwan deliberations have led to decisive government action.<sup><a href="#ftnt13"
         id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;One of the most notable processes, and the first to utilize the Polis software, was a 2015 <a

<p>The Taiwanese government shifted from making decisions that angered the neglected public<sup><a href="#ftnt15"
         id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup>&nbsp; to requiring each Ministry to create a vTaiwan forum account and holding
   them responsible for responding to citizens’ comments within seven days, resulting in a diverse range of topics being
   discussed on the platform, none of which are trivial. Although it tends to attract participants who often spur
   discussion on topics related to economics, data, and technology, vTaiwan has also exhibited its capacity to catalyze
   deliberation on issues of social justice such as the <a
      href="https://vtaiwan.tw/topic/nonconsensual-pornography&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400356000">Nonconsensual
      Pornography case</a>. </p>

<p>This <a
      href="https://g0v.news/vtaiwan-wins-big-at-the-2018-interaction-awards-94aa63b8c5a1&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400357000">award-winning
   </a>platform has been praised for its innovation, impressive technology, and its ability to bridge the gap between
   online and offline participation, as well as gaps between various sectors and citizens. From topics like the <a
      href="https://vtaiwan.tw/topic/sharing-economy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400357000">sharing economy</a>&nbsp;to <a
      href="https://vtaiwan.tw/topic/infosecurity&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400357000">security management</a>, vTaiwan
   continues to showcase its capacity to invite stakeholders of all backgrounds to identify problems and generate
   rational, collaborative, and productive dialogue about key issues, to the point where possible solutions are often
   put forth and agreed upon.</p>

<p>Overall, it has proven to be a multipurpose platform that can help all parties that wish to be involved. It enables
   Taiwanese citizens to bring their concerns to light in a manner where they can actually be heard, while also
   diminishing the burden placed on lawmakers and public servants by fostering open, productive collaboration and
   mitigating citizen opposition.
</p>

<p>The UberX case is touted as one of the most constructive processes facilitated through vTaiwan to date. Before the
   vTaiwan consultation, the regulation of ride sharing was a contentious topic.<sup><a href="#ftnt16"
         id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;Citizens were concerned for their safety as UberX did not require its
   drivers to obtain a professional driver’s license and was not subject to the same requirements as taxis. Taiwan’s
   taxi drivers complained that they were losing a significant portion of their business, hurting their income by 30
   percent, according to Chen Deng, Chairman of the Taipei City Taxi Passenger Transport Trade Association. <sup><a
         href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, as a result of the vTaiwan process, Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation and Communications pledged to ratify the
   consensus reached on Polis and amend the existing regulation consistent with the plans worked out online and agreed
   upon by <a href="https://www.uber.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400358000">Uber Inc</a>., the Association of
   Taxi Drivers in Taipei, <a
      href="http://www.taiwantaxi.com.tw/EN/en_about.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400358000">Taiwan Taxi</a>, and the
   Ministries of <a href="http://www.motc.gov.tw/en/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400358000">Transport and
      Communications</a>, <a
      href="https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/home/English.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400359000">Economic
      Affairs</a>, and <a href="https://www.mof.gov.tw/Eng/Home&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400359000">Finance</a>. These
   included such changes as:</p>
<ol start="1">
   <li>Taxis no longer need to be painted yellow.</li>
   <li>High-end app-based Taxis are free to operate as long as they do not undercut the existing taxi fare.</li>
   <li>App-based dispatch systems must display car and driver identification, estimated fare, and customer rating.</li>
   <li>Per-ride taxation would be imposed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Uber case is evidence for the claim that the vTaiwan process does more than merely collect opinions; it provides
   a method for genuinely improving legislation.

<p>vTaiwan offers a replicable, open-source model for supporting constructive collaboration between committed members of
   the public and public servants and suggests several lessons.
</p>

<p class="e-h2">Keeping it user-friendly</p>

<p>Although vTaiwan includes multiple stages and different tools, each component is simple and easy to
   understand.<sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;During a <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DZcYg7z-mwKk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400360000">presentation
      she gave in Paris</a>,Audrey Tang jokingly remarked that g0v is “a movement that tries everything [sic] to create
   a way for lazy people to engage in real action.” From using titles that are very slight offshoots of common existing
   references (gov→g0v, Taiwan→vTaiwan) to <a
      href="http://fact.g0v.tw/wikipedia/%25E5%2584%25AA%25E6%25AD%25A5%25E6%2599%2582%25E9%2596%2593%25E8%25BB%25B8&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400361000">creating
      timelines</a>&nbsp;to help participants understand the context of certain issues, vTaiwan makes every attempt to
   make their process simple and inclusive for everyone.
   &nbsp;</p>

<p class="e-h2">Engaging diverse audiences</p>

<p>With 85% of Taiwan&rsquo;s population online and 90% on Facebook,<sup><a href="#ftnt19"
         id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup>&nbsp;creating an online participation program was not a big stretch. What is
   unique is fostering a process to bring together different groups of people who do not usually work together,
   including tech experts, social activists, and public servants.
</p>

<div class="e-quote">
   <p class="">What is unique is fostering a process to bring together different groups of people who do not usually
      work together, including tech experts, social activists, and public servants.
   </p>
</div>
<p>Theg0v.tw and civic technology community have played an active role in developing new platforms for civic engagement beyond vTaiwan. One example is the civic engagement platform <a href="https://join.gov.tw/">Join</a>, which like vTaiwan uses Pol.is to build consensus, but is maintained by the government and aims to tackle regulatory topics beyond the digital economy. The Join platform has seen more than 10 million unique visitors since launching in 2015. 
</p>
<p><img src="{{'images/studies/vtaiwan/image3.png' | relative_url}}"></p>
<p class="e-caption">Figure 3: Interface of the Join platform<sup></p>
<p>Another example is the <a href="https://www.readr.tw/project/fact-check-2020">crowdsourcing platform</a> created by the vTaiwan community to fact-check the statements made by presidential candidates during public speeches in the lead-up to Taiwan’s 2020 election.g0v.tw even helped launch <a href="http://talkto.tw/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552496400361000">Talk to Taiwan</a>,a sibling
   project of vTaiwan consisting of a broadcast talk show where government ministers, mayors and scholars show up to
   respond to citizen ideas and concerns expressed via Polis.
</p>
<p>As Minister Tang said, “...I think [vTaiwan] is closer to the civic tech community than it is actually to my office or any minister...what we’re doing is institutionalizing the parts that worked.” Nonetheless, the vTaiwan community has made some efforts to institutionalize the process in law. One piece of legislation, a clause in the Digital Communications Acts, would have created a legal framework for the executive branch to respond to cross-ministerial issues that originated on forums like vTaiwan. However, this legislation, itself a product of vTaiwan, did not complete its parliamentary process in 2019. Regardless, there appears to be bipartisan support to create a dedicated authority to institutionalize digital policymaking processes like vTaiwan.
</p>

<p class="e-h2">Mandating engagement</p>

<p>vTaiwan’s organizers have emphasized the importance of trust between citizens, civil society, and the public
   sector.<sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;The government trusts activists to maintain this
   largely volunteer-run process, while the community activists trust the government to listen and use their insights
   and opinions to shape legislation. Building upon its initial commitment to use the platform, the additional
   requirement that began in 2017--that every ministry within the Taiwanese government assign at least one
   “participation officer” (PO) to “be involved in engagements with the civil society and to acquaint themselves with
   multi-stakeholder collaborative settings, as to shape regulations appropriate to their ministry”--is a crucial
   development.<sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup>&nbsp;Although many public officials are still reluctant participants, mandatory public engagement is beginning to create a culture of mutual trust.</p>
