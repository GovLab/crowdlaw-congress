   <p class="e-h2">How Does It Work?:</p>
   <p>Mexico’s Congress gave the Mayor of Mexico City exclusive authority to craft the city’s constitution, which would
      then be ratified by a constitutional assembly. However, to increase popular legitimacy, the Mayor, instead,
      established a working group tasked with receiving public input. The Lab for Mexico City set up the Constitución
      CDMX (CDMX referring to “Ciudad de México”) digital platform, which offered the public four ways to participate in
      the process: 1) a survey, 2) online petitions, 3) collaborative drafting, and 4) an event register. The
      opportunities to participate were heavily advertised via social media and local high school volunteers were
      enlisted to get out the word on street corners.

   </p>
</div>

<p>1) Survey: This seven question survey aimed to capture residents’ hopes and fears, expectations, and ideas for the
   future of the city and mapped them by age, gender and neighborhood.<p>
      <p>2) Online Petitions: The City collaborated with Change.org Mexico to set up a tool where residents could
         petition the working group. Any petition with 5,000 signatures was analyzed and a legal opinion was sent to the
         petition-maker and its signees. When a petition garnered 10,000 signatures, the proposing resident(s) would
         present their proposal to three representatives of the Working Group. When a petition surpassed 50,000
         signatures, the proposing resident(s) presented their proposal in a working session with the Mayor, who
         committed to explicitly include it in the constitutional draft.</p>
      <p>3) Collaborative Drafting: Residents could add their coments or suggestions to essays prepared by the Working
         Group that addressed questions of constitutional theory, proposals of a technical nature, and related academic
         papers using mMIT’s pubpub platform.</p>
      <p>4) Event Platform: An event platform was created that enabled resident-organized events related to the
         constitution to be promoted to increase participation. Event organizers could also upload the findings of their
         events to the collaborative editing platform and receive feedback from other platform users.</p>
      <p>Each week, the Working Group reviewed a summary of the Constitución CDMX platform’s activity, discussed the
         resident inputs and, with technical and legal support, reflected the result of their discussion in an evolving
         draft of the constitution. The Working Group’s final draft was then passed through the Mayor to the
         Constitutional Assembly which held responsibility for final review and endorsement of the constitution.</p>

      <p>What are the outcomes?:&nbsp;Within six months, 341 proposals were submitted as online petitions, and signed by
         more than 400,000 unique users. Four petitions surpassed the 50,000 signatures threshold, while another 11 got
         more than 10,000 signatures. In total, 14 petitions were successfully included in the Constitutional draft .
         Additionally, the survey mechanism generated 30,000 geo-tagged responses from 1,474 neighborhoods, accounting
         for 90% of all neighborhoods in Mexico City; 100 essays were submitted to the collaborative drafting platform
         and received 1000 comments; and 55 resident-organized events were registered. As a result, the final document
         is considered to be the most progressive constitution in Latin America, and it has been recognized by the
         United Nations as a “historical document that addresses the central challenges of development and peace” and as
         “a guide to fulfill the universal, indivisible and progressive nature of human rights, the Sustainable
         Development Goals, and the 2030 Agenda.”</p>


      <p class="e-h2">What does it cost?</p>
      <p>The platform development cost was $15,000. There were also additional costs for outreach and marketing, as well
         as digital kiosks and mobile devices which were used to encourage participation from citizens who did not have
         access to the Constitución CDMX platform online.</p>
      <p class="e-h2">What are the benefits?</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Having multiple ways to participate - from filling out a survey to writing a petition - encouraged more
            people to participate.</li>
         <li>The Mayor’s commitment to include language drafted by the public if it garnered enough signatures enhanced
            legitimacy. At the same time, the Mayor made clear that citizen proposals that did not reach the signature
            threshold would be considered but not automatically included. By clearly communicating these boundaries,
            expectations were surpassed.</li>
         <li>Partnership with a well-known brand name (Change.org) increased trust and participation in the process.
         </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="e-h2">What are the risks?</p>

      <ul>
         <li>The main challenge initially encountered was the lack of trust in the process and with the government -
            trust was essential to robust citizen participation.</li>
         <li>The still-present digital divide in Mexico City created implementation challenges and necessitated offering
            face-to-face participation options.</li>

      </ul>

      {% contentfor background %}
      <p>Earning the same rights and liberties as other states in the Mexican Republic had been a long fought social and
         political battle of Mexico’s capital city. Twenty years after the first mayoral election – the President used
         to appoint the city’s mayor – the creation of the first local constitution was supposed to be another milestone
         in the city’s democratization process. But a complex local political scenario and a nationwide distrust in
         government raised questions about the real utility of a new constitution for the continent’s biggest city. </p>

      <p>Mexicans’ trust in government and, more troubling, satisfaction with democracy, is at historic lows. According
         to the <a
            href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/10/16/democracy-widely-supported-little-backing-for-rule-by-strong-leader-or-military/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060801000">Pew
            Research Center</a>, a mere 2% of the Mexican population trust their government and only 6% of Mexicans are
         satisfied with the democratic system itself. These levels of dissatisfaction are below any other regional or
         international comparisons.</p>

      <p>Against this backdrop, when the National Congress designed a process for the creation of the city’s first
         constitution which did not contemplate public engagement, it threatened the legitimacy of the occasion.
         Instead, they granted the Mayor of Mexico City the exclusive authority to create the draft of the constitution,
         which would then be voted on by members of a Constitutional Assembly (40% appointed by other government
         branches and 60% democratically elected). But no popular participation was contemplated despite the fact that
         the new constitution would lay the groundwork for all other legal and institutional reforms to follow.</p>
      <p>Historically, Mexico City’s laws and institutions, especially regarding public security and budgetary affairs,
         had to have the Federal authorities’ approval. However, its new legal status granted the capital city more
         autonomy. Thus, following the enactment of a new constitution, a complete overhaul of existing laws would need
         to follow. Any lack of legitimacy of the original process could have called into question the legitimacy of
         these subsequent enactments and negatively impacted people’s hopes and expectations for the city’s future.</p>
      <p>Given this starting point, Mexico City had to come up with creative ways to innovate and recover the
         population’s trust in the constitutional process, while imagining new ways of communicating the importance of
         the new constitution in daily life. By using accessible yet substantive mechanisms, the city’s adoption of
         crowdlaw practices -- enabling ordinary citizens to participate -- would transform this fraught process into a
         more legitimate and effective one.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      {% endcontentfor %}


      {% contentfor cdmx %}
      <p>In order to open up the constitutive process, the Mayor established a Working Group (WG), comprised of 30
         leading citizens from different spheres of city life. Among the members of this group were activists, poets,
         artists, Olympians, constitutional experts, and deans and academic authorities of national universities.
         Parallel to this, the Mayor instructed <a href=”http://labcd.mx&sa=D&ust=1552450060803000”>Laboratorio para la
            Ciudad</a>– Mexico City’s creativity and experimentation office– to develop a <a
            href=”https://labcd.mx/experimentos/constitucion-cdmx/&sa=D&ust=1552450060803000”>methodology </a> and
            platform to channel popular opinions and proposals made for the Constitution to this working group.</p>
            <p>The Mayor committed not to veto or modify any draft made by the Working Group without the platform’s
            input.</p>
      <p>The Lab for Mexico City hired a small civic tech startup at the cost of $15,000, to build a <a
            href=”http://goo.gl/9WqrrN&sa=D&ust=1552450060804000”>digital platform</a> to facilitate public input. Staff
            at Laboratorio para la Ciudad and Mexico City’s General Counsel Office, who collaborated during the
            six-month period the platform remained active, jointly managed the process.</p> <p>The challenge was to
            design a platform versatile enough to fully comply with the Mayor’s commitment to integrate into the
            constitution all opinions and proposals generated by the people, regardless of the user’s knowledge of
            constitutional affairs, their academic background, or level of interest in public affairs.</p>


      <p><img src="{{'images/studies/cdmx/image1.png' | relative_url}}"></p>
      <p class="e-caption">Figure 1: Constituci&oacute;n CDMX digital platform.</p>
      <p>The platform offered four different options for the user to participate, depending on their interest in the
         matter, time availability, and level of knowledge about specific affairs and used Change.org and volunteers
         from Mexico City’s public high schools, who promoted offline participation in public spaces, as two mechanisms
         for spreading the word about the opportunity to participate.</p>

      <p>One participatory mechanism was the survey <a
            href="https://constitucion.cdmx.gob.mx/participa/%23imagina-ciudad&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060805000">Imagina
            tu
            Ciudad</a>, designed to elicit the citizen&rsquo;s hopes and fears, expectations, challenges, and ideas for
         the
         future of the city. Through a <a
            href="https://constitucion.cdmx.gob.mx/sondeo-masivo/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060805000">seven
            question</a>&nbsp;survey, the government aimed to obtain information on a general level about the
         people&rsquo;s
         hopes and expectations for the future of the city, the main challenges they identified, as well as its most
         valuable
         assets. This mechanism led to 31,000 geo-tagged submissions. This survey allowed the user and the government to
         navigate &ndash; by neighborhood, age, and gender &ndash; citizens&rsquo; gravest concerns and their visions
         for the
         future.</p>

      <p>Another way to interact with the platform was to draft <a
            href="http://change.org/constitucioncdmx&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060806000">an online petition</a>&nbsp;via
         Change.org. Mexico City’s Government became the first Mexican authority to commit to specific actions depending
         on the number of signatures the petition would gather. Any petition to obtain 5,000 signatures received a
         formal legal analysis by the city with that legal opinion sent to the petition-maker and signees. With 10,000
         signatures, the citizen got to present their proposal to three representatives of the Working Group. Those
         whose petitions surpassed a 50,000 signature threshold presented their petitions in a working session with the
         Mayor, who committed to explicitly include them in the constitutional draft to be debated and discussed.
         Within six months 341 proposals were submitted as online petitions, and signed by more than 400,000 unique
         users.<sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup> Four petitions surpassed the 50,000 signatures
         threshold, while another 11 got more than 10,000 signatures. In total, 14 petitions were successfully included
         in the Constitutional draft.</p>

      <p>The third mechanism was another collaborative drafting platform but this one gave people the chance to annotate
         and
         comment on essays written by the members of the Working Group dealing with constitutional theory, technical
         proposals, and academic papers. This platform was based on <a
            href="https://www.pubpub.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060807000">MIT Media Lab&rsquo;s PubPub</a>, which was
         used
         for policy making and public affairs by Mexico City&nbsp;in <a
            href="https://debatecd.mx/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060807000">previous exercises</a>. This mechanism allowed
         citizens to enrich published essays with commentaries and suggestions and open up discussions over specific
         contents
         of the text they deemed relevant. </p>

      <p>Annotation platforms might present themselves as the most obvious mechanism to engage in a Crowdlaw initiative.
         However, the team that implemented Constituci&oacute;n CDMX faced many challenges when trying to get people to
         engage
         in the discussion through it. It was the least popular participatory mechanism for the Mexico City exercise,
         due to
         the complexity of the texts it contained, and its unapproachability by a general audience. </p>

      <p>The <a
            href="https://constitucion.cdmx.gob.mx/participa/%23dialogos-publicos&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060808000">fourth
            mechanism</a>&nbsp;of Constituci&oacute;n CDMX allowed citizens to register any event they organized related
         to
         the Constitution. Additionally, organizers could upload their event&rsquo;s ideas and recommendations to the
         collaborative drafting platform and receive feedback from other users. </p>

      <p><img src="{{'images/studies/cdmx/image2.png' | relative_url}}"></p>
      <p class="e-caption">Figure 2: &ldquo;How to participate?&rdquo;. The platform hosted four different tools for
         civic
         engagement, <br>and an external link to the local Electoral Institute&rsquo;s webpage.<br> Source:
         Constituci&oacute;n CDMX digital platform.</p>

      <p>Each week, the managing team would present to the working group a summary of the platform&rsquo;s activity,
         including
         petitions&rsquo; growth, new answers to the survey, as well as a summary of the registered events and
         collaborative
         essays. These inputs were discussed by the Group in its weekly meetings and integrated into the texts that
         would
         eventually become the city&rsquo;s first constitution. </p>


      {% endcontentfor %}

      {% contentfor crowd %}
      <p>Patricio, a 16-year old high school student, &nbsp;lives in Magdalena Contreras, a borough in the southwestern
         outskirts of Mexico City proper. Waters from the surrounding mountains descend to the Valley of Mexico through
         this
         borough. Being a daily witness to the deteriorating state of the rivers in his neighborhood, Patricio started
         an <a href="http://goo.gl/emYahz&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060809000">online petition</a>&nbsp;asking the City to
         include
         in the constitution the cleansing and rescue of Mexico City&#39;s rivers.</p>

      <p>Patricio&#39;s petition in Change.org gathered more than 17,000 signatures. Even though he was not old enough
         to cast
         a vote for the Constitutional Assembly that approved the constitution, his voice was part of the group of
         citizens
         whose proposals were included in the Constitutional draft. Now, Mexico City has to set forward a 20-year
         programmatic
         strategy towards the recovery of its rivers, water bodies and resources (article 16, Section B of Mexico
         City&rsquo;s
         Constitution). </p>

      <p>Patricio&rsquo;s story is an example on how Constituci&oacute;n CDMX platform achieved its objective of
         including the
         voices of all those who wanted to participate in the drafting process of the constitution, regardless of their
         citizenship status, background, age or educational level. Moreover, his involvement and engagement in the
         process
         went beyond the traditional conception and mechanisms of electoral democracy, and even participatory democracy,
         that
         demand a minimum age to take into consideration the opinions and needs of many members of the community. </p>

      {% endcontentfor %}

      {% contentfor instimpactsolo %}
      <p>Mexico City now has a constitution created through a popular co-creation process that managed to channel
         hundreds of
         thousands of citizen inputs and efficiently process them into useful insights. Besides the benefits this open
         process
         represents, it is important to note that the most progressive aspects in the constitution have their origin in
         the
         civic engagement process: Marriage equality, the explicit recognition of the Right to the City, rights of
         indigenous
         and aboriginal peoples, cultural rights, pro-choice policies, marijuana consumption, and other aspects of the
         constitution were supported by citizens&rsquo; petitions and proposals delivered through Constituci&oacute;n
         CDMX.
      </p>

      <p>By combining a process of self-selected public engagement with a selection process, where members of the
         constitutional assembly were, at least in part elected, the City was able to enhance the legitimacy of the
         process.
      </p>

      <p>Being a progressive hub in the middle of a highly conservative country, Mexico City managed to imprint in its
         new
         constitution the will of its people to continue to lead the Human Rights agenda, the recognition of liberties,
         and
         the protection of diversity, despite Federal opposition to these subjects. On an international scale, this
         document
         set a high bar for cities worldwide in the acknowledgement and recognition of new approaches to urban
         challenges for
         the 21st century. </p>

      <p>Approximately 84% of the content produced by this co-creation scheme was approved by a qualified majority in
         the
         Constitutional Assembly and entered into force as Mexico City&rsquo;s first constitution on September 17th,
         2018. The
         required majority couldn&rsquo;t have been reached by the Mayor&rsquo;s political allies on their own, but was
         made
         possible by a citizen-led process for developing the new constitution.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The depth &nbsp;of public engagement in the process can be demonstrated in the explicit recognition of it made
         by the
         Mexican Supreme Court in its&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.scjn.gob.mx/sites/default/files/actas-sesiones-publicas/documento/2017-08-18/73.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060811000">decision</a>&nbsp;regarding
         the constitutionality of the whole process, which was challenged by the Federal Government once the
         constitution was
         approved. The Justices argued that by having representatives of both persons with disabilities and indigenous
         peoples
         participating through the online petitions facilitated by the platform, Mexico City complied with the
         international
         consultation requirements that protect these vulnerable groups from any normative modification that could
         potentially
         affect them. <br></p>
      {% endcontentfor %}

      {% contentfor risks %}
      <p>Governments around the world are facing the challenge of rebuilding trust with citizens. The strategy
         implemented by
         Mexico City demonstrates that while opening up decision making processes will usually cost additional time and
         resources,&nbsp;investing in openness and co-creation will ultimately lead to more reliable results.</p>

      <p>Mexico City&rsquo;s constitutional process took place within a complex political and social context. The main
         challenge the team initially encountered when asking the citizens to participate through the platform was the
         lack of
         trust in the process. The partnership established with Change.org was a key element to regaining citizen trust.
         Even
         though the survey Imagina tu Ciudad was originally expected to be the participatory mechanism with a critical
         mass of
         users, the petition-making scheme turned out to be the most popular among users. The team behind the strategy
         attributes this to the fact that the mechanism was branded with the Change.org name and the platform already
         had a
         well-known reputation. </p>

      <p>Another challenge for the implementation of Constituci&oacute;n CDMX was the digital divide that is still
         present in
         Mexico City. Even though the capital city ranks highest in the national measurements of households with
         internet
         access, this citywide initiative required the government to offer the opportunity to participate regardless of
         the
         people&rsquo;s ability to access the digital platform. To address this challenge, the city deployed digital
         kiosks to
         reach citizens on the streets and public spaces. </p>
      <p><img src="{{'images/studies/cdmx/image3.png' | relative_url}}"></p>

      <p class="e-caption">Figure 3: High school volunteers and digital kiosks in Mexico City&rsquo;s Plaza de la
         Rep&uacute;blica <br>Photo credits: Laboratorio para la Ciudad.</p>

      <p>This outreach strategy was implemented in collaboration with the National Polytechnic Institute&rsquo;s High
         School
         students. A <a href="http://goo.gl/oNX41s&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060813000">gamification strategy </a>was
         designed
         to encourage them to recruit people to take part with awards for those who attracted the most participants.
         &nbsp;The
         teams used social media as well as photos and videos to certify the participation of citizens in different
         public
         spaces and public transport stations.&nbsp;When technology failed and the digital kiosks were not able to
         access the
         platform, the students designed an analog version of the surveys and carried on with the civic engagement in
         flea
         markets, subway stations, and other places that did not have internet coverage. </p>

      {% contentfor experience %}
      <p>Thanks to the interaction between the group of petition-makers and the city&nbsp;officials, perceptions of, and
         confidence in, one another changed. Francisco Fontano, the first petition-maker to reach the benchmark of
         10,000
         signatures, is a sports journalist that advocated for the constitution to include a minimum requirement of
         green
         areas per capita. Manuel Granados served as Mexico City&rsquo;s General Counsel, in charge of coordinating the
         works
         of the Drafting Group as well as the interactions with citizens derived from the platform. Before Francisco got
         to
         present his proposal to the General Counsel and 3 representatives of the WG, he told the Lab&rsquo;s team about
         how
         nervous he was meeting firsthand a senior government official. What Francisco didn&rsquo;t know is that
         Granados was
         even more nervous to hold a working session with an unknown citizen representing more than 10,000 other people.
         Before this collaboration scheme took place, Change.org was regarded by public officials as a tool for
         opposition
         members, activists or pressure groups to generate bad press for Government, and thus its real usefulness was
         regarded
         with skepticism.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As these meetings continued, trust between both parties evolved. This renewed relationship based on trust can
         be
         perceived in the <a href="http://goo.gl/aWVnQt&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060820000">series of interviews
         </a>Laboratorio para la Ciudad conducted with the petition-makers, as well as in the<a
            href="http://goo.gl/yEXgWg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552450060820000">&nbsp;messages they sent</a>&nbsp;to their
         thousands
         of supporters in their petitions.</p>

      <p>Mexico City&rsquo;s approach of offering a series of diverse approaches and mechanisms, each of which was
         accompanied
         by a firm commitment from the City to act on the engagement, offered a more democratic, citizen-friendly and
         replicable method that can&nbsp;be replicated for any legislative crowdsourcing strategy.</p>
